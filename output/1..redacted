LETTER FROM COLLEGE

An exact replica of a letter a daughter wrote to ███ parents
from college

Dear Mom and ███:

██ has now been three months since █ left for college. █
have been remiss in writing ████ and █ am very sorry for ██
thoughtlessness in not having written before. █
will bring ███ up to date now, but, before ███ read on,
please sit down.

███ ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS ███ ARE SITTING ████.

OKAY! Well, then, █ am getting along pretty well now. The
skull fracture and the concussion █ got when █ jumped out of
the window of ██ dormitory when ██ caught
fire shortly after ██ arrival are pretty well healed now. █
only get those sick headaches once a day.

Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and ██ jump were
witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,
and ██ was the one ███ called the fire department
and the ambulance. ██ also visited ██ at the hospital and,
since █ had nowhere to live because of the burned out
dormitory, ██ was kind enough to invite ██ to share
███ apartment with ███. ██'s really a basement room, but
██'s kind of cute.

██ is a very fine ███ and ██ have fallen deeply in love and
are planning to be married. ██ haven't set the exact date
yet, but ██ will be before ██ pregnancy
begins to show.

Yes, Mother and ███, █ am pregnant. █ know how much ███ are
looking forward to being grandparents and █ know ███ will
welcome the baby and give ██ the love,
devotion and tender care ███ gave ██ when █ was a child.

The reason for the delay in ███ marriage is that ██
█████████ has some minor infection, █████ prevents ██ from
passing ███ pre-marital blood tests, and █
carelessly caught ██ from ███. ████ will soon clear up with
the penicillin injections █ am having daily. █ know ███ will
welcome ███ into ███ family with open arms. ██ is kind and,
although not well educated, ██ is ambitious. Although ██ is
of a different race and religion than ours, █ know ████
often-expressed tolerance will not permit ███ to be bothered
by the fact that ███ skin color is somewhat different from
ours. █ am sure ███ will love ███ as █ do.

███ family background is good too, for █ am told that ███
██████ is an important gun-bearer in the village from █████
██ came.

Now that █ have brought ███ up to date, █ want to tell ███
that █████ was no dormitory fire, █ did not have a
concussion or a skull fracture. █ was not in the hospital, █
am not pregnant, █ am not engaged. █ do not have syphilis
and █████ is no ███ in ██ life.

However, █ am getting a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science
and █ wanted ███ to see those marks in the proper perspective.

Yours,

████ Loving Daughter.
