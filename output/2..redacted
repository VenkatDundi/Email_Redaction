Hotwanger,

Unemployment is not █████████ to be taken lightly. With the right approach, ██ can be a richly 
fulfilling experience. The wrong approach can leave ███ unsatisfied and disenchanted.
Or dissatisfied and unenchanted. ████████. █████ is a bit of a science involved.
A few tips:
	If ███ are living with ███████...█████ ███ are...██ is important ████ ███ not wake ███
up when ███ is on ███ way to work, as ███ likely have nowhere to go at ████ hour anyway. 
Tell ███ to blow dry ███ hair in the car or don't bother. If ███ wants ███ to do █████████ to help
███ out, like make breakfast, pour a bowl of cereal the night before and put ██ in the fridge. If
███ gets bored with ████, put ██ in the freezer for an icy treat.
	Waking up mid-afternoon may make ██ difficult for ███ to get to sleep at a decent
hour, and ████ sleep cycle may become so offset ████ ███ are actually never awake when 
████ is. ████ will likely become a sticking point. Drinking during the afternoon will put ███ in
a drowsy state of mind come nightfall, and ███ can ensure a regular 14 hrs of slumber.
	█████ are things to do in a new city, but ████ are overrated. TV can and will provide
whatever culture ███ think ███ need. Go outside only for beer or fast food. 
	At ████ point, █████ may be pressure on ███ to "look for a job." ████ is an overly
vague request. ███ are likely developing and formulating a career direction with ████ time 
off, and a job would take away from this "██" time and set ███ back months.
	█ took a run at unemployment last year, but with the added wrinkle of no TV. ████
is a challenge █ wouldn't recommend on ████ first attempt. Removing ███ from even a
premium cable package would be akin to taking a polio sufferer out of an iron lung.
	Malt liquor + taco bell █████████████ = projectile diarrhea.

████'s ██ for now. █ have to get to a meeting. Give ██ ████ feedback on how things shake
out. In the coming days, █ will send out a supplement newsletter on the benefits of 
substitute teaching.

Later,
J Wolfe

Hello Fellows. Just a quick note to ██ H-Town homeboys as ██ were. ███ of
███ float away in the floods? ██████, █ heard ███ had ████ damage, sorry to
hear about ████. If ███ of ███ have brilliant ideas for a new and exciting
career for ██ to pursue, █'m ███ ears. This unemployment thing is getting a
bit old. ███, if ███ have ███ advice on how to make the most of these days,
speak up. █ like to learn from the masters. █'m going to a place called
█████████████ tonight for █████'s birthday. ██'s considered by ████ to be
the best steak ███ can buy in ███████. ██'ll see how ██ stacks up to ██████.
Take ██ easy boys.

--Eric
