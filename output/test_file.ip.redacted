As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information

with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

A video conference is being organized to enable broad participation from the

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest
